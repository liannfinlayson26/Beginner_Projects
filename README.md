# Essential Learning Portfolio

I develop multiple projects that helped me understand and master skills that are essential in Python. This projects involved concepts like:
+ Flow control
+ 
<br>This projects are:

## **13. The Higher Lower Game:** 
<br> Description:
+ Key learnings:
+ Difficulties:
+ Code:
## <br>**12. The Number Guessing Game:**
<br> Description:
+ Key learnings:
+ Difficulties:
+ Code:
## <br>**11. Blackjack:**
<br> Description: a game that allows to play blackjack 21 with a computer. 
+ Key learnings: applied the concepts of functions and control flow to execute a series of decisions and actions that determine an outcome for each round of the game.
+ Difficulties: applying the game logic that perform the taks of dealing cards, calculate the score in each round following the rules and keep track of the card count for the player and the computer using control flow to make it work.
+ Code: https://github.com/liannfinlayson26/Essential-Learning-Portfolio/blob/11_Blackjack/main.py
## <br>**10. Calculator:**
<br> Description: a program that allows to do multiple mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division).
+ Key learnings: applied my knowledge in dictionaries and functions
+ Difficulties: learning and applying the concept of recursion to continue doing operations in the calculator with a previous result of a calculation.
+ Code:https://github.com/liannfinlayson26/Essential-Learning-Portfolio/blob/10_Calculator/main.py
## <br> **9. Blind Auction Program:**
<br> Description: A multiplayer game that allows you to compete for the highest bid. The one with the highest bid wins.
+ Key learnings: How to apply the knowledge of dictionaries to create a program that allowed us to input several information
+  Difficulties: The use of a while loop to create a dictionary that iterate through a set of {keys: values}
+  Code: https://github.com/liannfinlayson26/Essential-Learning-Portfolio/blob/9_Blind_Auction_Program_Solved/main.py 
## <br> **8. Caesar Cipher:**
<br> Description: A program that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of position down or up the alphabet. 
+  Difficulties: 
+  Code: 
## <br> **7. Hangman:**
<br> Description: the program chooses a random word and we have to guessed which word it is. If we fail to guess the letters we lose!
+ Key learnings: lists, for and while loops
+ Code: https://github.com/liannfinlayson26/Essential-Learning-Portfolio/blob/7_Hangman/main.py

## <br> **6. Hurdles Challenge:**
<br> Description: A maze in Reeborg's World where the robot must reach the exit.
+ Key learnings: applied what I learned about if, elif and while statements. Also using the not statement.
+ Difficulties: how to debug the code when the robot is facing in certain directions. Like facing forward for example.
+ Code: https://github.com/liannfinlayson26/Essential-Learning-Portfolio/blob/6_Hurdles_Challenge/Maze%20(1).py
## <br> **5. Password Generator:**
<br> Description: a program that uses the random module to create a password based on a criteria: different numbers, symbols and letters.
+ Key learnings: random modules and list.
+ Code: https://github.com/liannfinlayson26/Essential-Learning-Portfolio/blob/5_Password_Generator/main.py

## <br> **4. Rock Paper Scissors:**
<br> Description: a game that allows you to play the game rock, paper scissors with a computer. 
+ Key learnings: applied multiple for loops
+ Code: https://github.com/liannfinlayson26/Essential-Learning-Portfolio/blob/4_Rock_Paper_Scissors/main.py
## <br>**3. Treasure Island:**
<br> Description: A game where you must make a decision. If the decision is correct, it will lead you to find a treasure on the island. However, you will have to overcome different obstacles to obtain it!
+ Key learnings: applied the If, elif and else statements to develop the game.
+ Code: https://github.com/liannfinlayson26/Essential-Learning-Portfolio/blob/3_Treasure_Island/main.py

## <br>**2. Tip Calculator:**
<br> Description: a program that allows to divide or split the bill, with a specific percentage and tip included.
+ Key learnings: applied data types knowledge (integers, floats, strings) and F strings.
+ Code: https://github.com/liannfinlayson26/Essential-Learning-Portfolio/blob/2_Tip_Calculator/main.py

## <br>**1. Band Name Generator:**
<br> Description: a program that allows to create a Band name with the name of your country and your pet's name.
+ Key learnings: applied the input function.
+Code: https://github.com/liannfinlayson26/Essential-Learning-Portfolio/blob/1_Band_Name_Generator/main.py
